*nf-tweet*

This repository contains a Proof-of-Concept (POC) of a Nextflow plugin for gathering data from Twitter. It serves as a good example for developers interested in developing plugins for other data sources.

Quick overview
==============
You must obtain a Twitter Developer account so that you can request a bearer token. With that done, add your bearer token to a file named `twitter_bearer_token` in the same directory as the `main.nf` file.

You can run the current version of the `main.nf` script with:

```
nextflow run `main.nf`
```
